# Dubtrack

## Overview

Dubtrack is a URL shortener and tracker that allows users to generate QR codes for short links. The application is designed to provide analytics and insights for each QR code scanned.

## Features

- **Short URL Generation** â€“ Create shortened URLs with automatically generated short codes.
- **QR Code Generation** â€“ Generate a QR code for each shortened link.
- **Analytics** â€“ Track QR code scans, including time, location, and user agent.
- **Dockerized PostgreSQL Database** â€“ Uses PostgreSQL hosted in a Docker container for reliable data storage.
- **Custom Shortcodes (Upcoming Feature)** â€“ Users will soon be able to define their own shortcodes for URLs instead of auto-generated ones.
